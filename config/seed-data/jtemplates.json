These options \n      range from consultation on the low end (notification only) to deep consultation (which would include \n      various consultation activities conducted by both EAO and the proponent), with moderate consultation \n      activities in the middle.<br><br>\n      This section includes standard language for three possible “levels” or “tiers” of consultation, some \n      or all of which may be included in a section 11 Order, depending on how different parts of the project \n      might potentially affect Aboriginal Interests. Note: it is not necessary to include all three “tiers” \n      in every section 11 Order. You should select the consultation opportunities that are most appropriate \n      for your particular proposed Project.<br><br>\n      There is some degree of flexibility in adjusting the description of consultation activities for each of \n      the three “tiers,” but project leads should be cognizant that any changes will reduce the consistency \n      between section 11 Orders, and may lead to differing expectations from Aboriginal Groups about how they \n      are to be consulted at each level. In considering any changes to the activities available at each level, \n      remember that the scope of consultation should be proportionate to the strength of any claimed aboriginal \n      rights or title, and seriousness of impacts to the claimed rights or determined aboriginal or treaty rights \n      (Haida spectrum).<br><br>\n      If you are unsure of how to determine which Aboriginal Groups to include on which schedule, start by \n      reviewing the consultation resources on e-guide, particularly the “Steps for Assessing Strength of \n      Aboriginal Rights Claims” and the “EA Consultation Framework” (see this page: \n      <a href=\"http://eaogww.bcgov/eguide/general_resources/first_nations.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n      http://eaogww.bcgov/eguide/general_resources/first_nations.html)</a>. You should note that if, following \n      the issuance of a section 11 Order, new information becomes available related to an Aboriginal Group’s \n      strength of claim or potential to be impacted as a result of the proposed Project, you can issue a section \n      13 Order moving that group from one schedule to another, based on the way that this new information affects \n      the Aboriginal Groups’ placement on the Haida spectrum.<br><br>\n      If you have any questions about determining which schedules to use, please seek legal review on the \n      consultation components of your section 11 Order.\n    </div>\n    <p>\n      <b>12.
