Results of this monitoring must be submitted to FLNRO.\nThe Proponent must implement a ML/ARD sampling program of both rock and water at the onset of the detailed design phase, when the road and tower locations are finalised, using the Guidelines For Metal Leaching and Acid Rock Drainage at Minesites in British Columbia (Ministry of Energy and Mines 1998) and the Policy for Metal Leaching and Acid Rock Drainage at Minesites in British Columbia (Ministry of Energy and Mines 1998). The Proponent must employ a QRP ML/ARD consultant to recommend, review and design all ML/ARD work.\nWhen the final layout of roads and turbine foundations is confirmed, the first phase of fieldwork must begin to identify, describe and map all bedrock and surficial materials exposed, excavated or disturbed by construction, including turbine foundations and building pad areas. Samples must be submitted for ML/ARD potential testing. Based on the results, modifications to the layout must be made where a significant risk may exist, as determined by a QRP.  \nA mitigation and monitoring plan must be developed by a QRPML/ARD consultant to recommend, review and design all ML/ARD work. The consultants must provide the Proponent with final reports based on the results of ML/ARD potential analysis, using the following mitigation strategies:\nï¿½ Avoidance: The most effective mitigation strategy and the first that must be considered is avoidance through prediction and surface road planning, although significant potentially acid generating (PAG) lithologies are not expected to be encountered on Nahwitti Plateau.\nï¿½ Covering: The Policy for Metal Leaching and Acid Rock Drainage at Minesites in British Columbia (1998) recommends engineered covers can be used to reduce the supply of oxygen for sulphide oxidation. They can also be used to reduce ML and contaminant loads resulting from the infiltration of incident rainfall and snow melt. The Proponent must use QRP engineers for cover design. For a two lane width road surface, this may be an appropriate method of mitigation over a short distance. In instances where it is not suitable, such as where discharge must not meet requirements, it may be more appropriate to use avoidance and move the road.\nï¿½ Blending of potentially acid generating (PAG) wastes with materials with excess neutralization potential (NP), or non-potentially acid generating (NPAG) wastes can be a successful mitigation strategy. Characterization of the materials and mitigation plans must be site specific. The Proponent must follow recommendations for blending based on analytical results, provided by a professional consultant in ML/ARD.\nThe Proponent must begin monitoring during the initial onset of the design phase and must include analytical testing of streams and rocks as determined by a QRP, including duration and frequency of monitoring.\nThe Proponent must monitor stream water quality where a QRP determines significant risk for ML/ARD exists during project design, construction and operation, and must begin as soon as road locations have been confirmed.\n",
