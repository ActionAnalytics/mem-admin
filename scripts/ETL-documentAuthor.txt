The document author was set on upload to match the user who did the upload. This behaviour changed July 2017.
We need to now clear everything in the document author field.
Run the following in mongo after PR#1 is migrated to production.

db.documents.updateMany({documentAuthor :{ $ne : null }},{ $unset: { documentAuthor: ""}})
db.documents.updateMany({documentAuthor :{ $eq : "" } },{ $unset: { documentAuthor: ""}})

Run this to be sure everything is clear:
db.documents.find({documentAuthor :{ $ne : null }},{documentAuthor:1})
